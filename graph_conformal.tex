\chapter{Conformal Prediction for Graph Structured Data}
\label{chp:graphConformal}
The previous chapter used confidence intervals to generate online, anytime-valid bounds for the outputs associated with different decision-making models.
However, confidence intervals require a strong assumption about the data-generating distribution at test time, i.e., independent and identically distributed (IID) data.
For graph-structured data, the edges between different nodes denote potential dependencies between the nodes.
Thus, the IID assumption is violated, and the corresponding confidence intervals are no longer a viable option.
\emph{Conformal prediction} is a method that provides valid confidence sets/intervals for graph-structured data under a weaker assumption - exchangeability.
While the estimates generated by conformal prediction are no longer online or anytime-valid, the associated guarantees can provide a foundation for understanding the uncertainty associated with the predictions in graph-structured data.
This chapter will discuss the theoretical underpinnings of conformal prediction and the tradeoffs associated with its application to graph-structured data.

Conformal prediction has become increasingly popular for quantifying the uncertainty associated with machine learning models. 
The computational efficiency of the split conformal prediction approach has made it the method du jour for exploring new approaches for quantifying the uncertainty of predictions from large, computationally expensive machine learning models.
Recent work in graph uncertainty quantification has built upon this approach for conformal prediction on graphs.
The nascent nature of these explorations has led to conflicting choices for implementations, baselines, and evaluation of approaches.
We critically analyze the choices made and describe the tradeoffs associated with existing graph conformal prediction work. 
Our theoretical and empirical results provide the rationale for our recommendations for future scholarship in graph conformal prediction.
