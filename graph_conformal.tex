\chapter{Conformal Prediction for Graph Structured Data}
\label{chp:graphConformal}
In the previous chapter, confidence intervals were used to generate online, anytime-valid bounds for the outputs associated with different decision-making models.
However, confidence intervals require a strong assumption on the data-generating distribution at test time i.e, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) data.
For graph structured data, the edges between different nodes denote potential dependencies between the nodes.
Thus, the i.i.d assumption is violated, and i.i.d. confidence intervals are no longer a valid option.
Conformal prediction is a method that provides valid confidence sets/intervals for graph structured data under a weaker assumption - exchangeability.
While the estimates generated by conformal prediction are no-longer online or anytime-valid, the associated guarantees can provide a foundation for understanding the uncertainty associated with the predictions in graph structured data.
In this chapter, we will discuss the theoretical underpinnings of conformal prediction and the trade-offs associated with its application to graph structured data.

%Following this, in the second part, we will conclude with a discussion of extending conformal prediction for studying the fairness of decision-making models trained for graph structured data.

%\section{Understanding the Tradeoffs in Graph Conformal Prediction}

Conformal prediction has become increasingly popular as a method for quantifying the uncertainty associated with machine learning models. 
The computational efficiency of the split conformal prediction approach has made it the method du jour for exploring new approaches for quantifying the uncertainty of predictions from large, computationally expensive machine learning models.
Recent work in graph uncertainty quantification has built upon this approach for conformal prediction on graphs.
The nascent nature of these explorations has lead to conflicting choices for implementations, baselines, and evaluation of approaches.
We critically analyze the choices made and describe the trade-offs associated with existing graph conformal prediction work. 
Our theoretical and empirical results provide the rationale for our recommendations for future scholarship in graph conformal prediction.
