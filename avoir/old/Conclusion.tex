\section{Conclusion}
We present the \AVOIRmethodname{} framework for easily defining and monitoring fairness specifications online and aids in the interactive refinement of specifications. \AVOIRmethodname{} is easy to integrate within modern database systems but can also serve as a standalone system evaluating whether blackbox machine learning models are meeting specific fairness criteria on specific datasets (including both structured and unstructured data) as described in our case studies.
\AVOIRmethodname{} extends the grammar from Fairness Aware Programming~\cite{albarghouthi2019fairness} with operations that enhance expressiveness.
In addition we derive probabilistic guarantees that improve the confidence with which specification violations are reported.
To assist in refinement of specifications, we develop an interactive visual analysis application within \AVOIRmethodname{}.
Through case studies, we demonstrate that \AVOIRmethodname{} can provide users with insights that contribute directly to refinement decisions.
Our framework builds the foundation for further improvements to the fairness specification, auditing and verification workflow.
We plan to extend this work to provide intelligent specification refinement suggestions and support distributed machine learning settings. We also plan to explore the use of \AVOIRmethodname{} for fair ranking problems and tailored database integration.
