\chapter{Towards Robust Author Representations}
\label{chp:stylometry_extensions}

In the previous chapter, we explored the applicability of graph structure in augmenting author identification models. 
However, we were limited to generalizing across different forums and across time.
In this chapter, we will explore the applicability of models trained for author representation learning on large, clear web datasets.
We will first quantify whether such models can be used to improve author identification on darkweb forums.
Further, we will evaluate the limitations of models trained on large, clear web datasets  generalizing across time and demographics.
We will conclude this discussion with some prospective directions that utilize uncertainty quantification as a data and computationally efficient method to provide bounds on the generalization capabilities of these models.
We investigate the research questions using the LUAR model~\citep{riverastao2021learning} as the base author representation model, described in the following text.
The first part of this work was also presented as a conference talk at the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre's Sixth Annual Cybercrime Conference~\citep{maneriker2023following}.
