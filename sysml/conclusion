We develop a novel stylometry-based multitask learning approach that leverages graph context to construct low-dimensional representations of short episodes of user activity for authorship and identity attribution. Our results on four different darknet forums suggest that both graph context and multitask learning provides a significant lift over the state-of-the-art. 
In the future, we hope to evaluate how such methods can be levered to analyze how users maintain trust while retaining anonymous identities as they migrate across markets. 
Further, we hope to quantitatively evaluate the migration detection to assess the evolution of textual style and language use on darknet markets. % as a key part of the digital forensics toolkit for studying such markets. 
Characterizing users from a small number of episodes has important applications in limiting the propagation of bot and troll accounts, which will be another direction of future work.
%\textcolor{red}{In the future we speculate that it may be feasible to adapt more complex embedding-dependent sampling strategy~\cite{wu2017sampling} that may improve upon softmax margins.}
